Feature: Running a test
  As an iOS developer
  I want to have a sample feature file
  So I can begin testing quickly

Scenario: Example steps
  Given I am on the Welcome Screen
  Then I touch the "findkronicle" button
  Then I wait for the "myfirstkronicle" button to appear
  Then I touch the "myfirstkronicle" button
  Then I touch list item number 1
  Then I wait for the "gotokronicle" button to appear
  Then I touch the "gotokronicle" button
  Then I wait for 4 seconds
  Then I scroll down
  Then I scroll down
  Then I wait for 2 seconds 
  Then I scroll up
  Then I scroll up
  Then I wait for 2 seconds
  Then I touch the "backbutton" button
